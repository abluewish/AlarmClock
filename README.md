# AlarmClock
Build an alarm clock with Arduino programmer

In this alarm clock project, I let the buzzer on when the time displayed is 00:00:01.
The time displayed on the screen is the time remaining.
Two buttons on the bigger blend board can control how many hours and minutes remaining.
The other button can stop buzzer.
